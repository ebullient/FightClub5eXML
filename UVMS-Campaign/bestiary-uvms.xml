        <description>A scarred grizzled veteran of many battles in many places, the orc campaigner has seen it all. Or at least, that’s what he would have you believe. And aside from the bloodletting, he didn’t like any of it.

        <description>Sniffers are usually small and wiry, more akin to a big goblin or hobgoblin in stature. They are no less vicious or bloodthirsty than other orcs, though, and they are very fond of the flesh of other sapient creatures. They pride themselves on being good trackers.
